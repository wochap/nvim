# NVIM

The perfect blazingly fast Neovim configuration for myself, combining the aesthetics of [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) with the LSP, formatter and lint configurations from [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

## Installation

```sh
# optionally uninstall previous nvim config
$ rm -rf ~/.cache/nvim
$ rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
$ rm -rf ~/.local/state/nvim

# installation
$ git clone git@github.com:wochap/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
$ nvim
# wait for lazy.nvim to finish, then restart nvim
# enter nvim and repeat the installation step once more
```

**IMPORTANT:** I disabled nvim builtin syntax which caused severe lag on my system, re enable it commenting out the line `lua/custom/init.lua:6`. Alternatively, you can install the Treesitter parser for the specified language or enable syntax for that specified filetype in the current buffer with `:set syntax=<filetype>`.

**IMPORTANT:** I have disabled Treesitter highlighting for minified files and files with long lines. Refer to the `is_minfile` function in `lua/custom/utils/init.lua` for details.

## Troubleshooting

- Lag

  Try using a faster and better terminal, such as [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot)

- Anything Eslint related

  Run in nvim

  ```
  :w %
  :e %
  ```

  If that didn't work, kill all eslint processes

- Python LSP/Linters installed by Mason stopped working

  Uninstall them and install them again

## Tips to learn to use this nvim config

- Learn [https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), then remove all lazy.nvim plugin specs that you are not going to use in `lua/custom/plugins/*`. For example, if you don't code zig, remove `lang-zig.lua`. If you don't use Kitty, remove `lua/custom/plugins/kitty.lua`.
- Keymaps are located in `lua/custom/keymaps.lua` (global), `lua/custom/plugins/lsp/keymaps.lua` (active when an LSP server is running), and within each plugin spec.
- If you need autoformatting on save, create an autocmd that calls `conform.nvim`.
- Formatting, linting, and LSP config are the same as in Lazyvim, so feel free to import extras from Lazyvim, and add LSP servers in the same manner you did in Lazyvim.
- If you use a different theme than catppuccino, replace the plugin spec in `lua/custom/plugins/colorscheme/init.lua`. Also, update the configurations for lualine, bufferline, and lazy.nvim.

Lastly read all lua files ðŸ˜…, starting from `lua/custom/init.lua`
